# Team_Formation_Java

Selecting some particular people from a social network based on specific search criteria is known as team formation problem. Team formation problem are not only shown is operation research but also in software engineering(social media, job searching website, cloud computing, software testing) , machine learning and on and on. But forming teams is a major challenge given the limitations of overlapping search criteria, data volumes, and geographic and cross-organizational boundaries and considered as a nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard problem.

In recent years, the NP-hard issue of forming teams from expertise networks has attracted a great deal of research interest in the optimization field. Among the suggested optimization methods, metaheuristics have been shown to be the most economical in terms of computing time and resources, while the size of the expert networks is very substantial.

# Metaheuristics Multitasking Optimization Algorithms
Metaheuristics solve team formation problem as a Set Covering Problem(SCP). In the initialization stage of the SCP solution model, the experts’ network is encoded into a unified solution space known as solution representation so that computation can be efficient. This solution representation also opens a door for transfer optimization, knowledge for solving one problem can be utilized to solve other problem. If two problems shared the same solution representation, it is possible to solve them sequentially or concurrently and transfer knowledge between two tasks so that each task can get the optimal results in the single search process. This new way of solving mutually exclusive optimization problems is known as multitasking.
